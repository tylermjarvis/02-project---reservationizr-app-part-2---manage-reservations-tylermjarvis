# 02 Project - Reservationizr Application - Manage Reservations

## Assessment details

- Assesment details are on iQualify classroom

---

# Scenario

You are working for a new startup, Reservationizr. It allows customers to make reservations at any of their local restaurants from one place.

The previous Software Engineer started building the application but was urgently re-assigned to a different part of the business. You need to complete the remaining user stories for the web application, following the documentation below.

Your Tech Lead can support you if you need help understanding the requirements or are blocked with something in particular.

---

# Getting started

The `client` folder contains the React Application, and the `server` folder contains the Express application.

## Client

- In a new Terminal window, type: `cd client` to change directory into the client folder
- Type `npm install` to install npm dependencies
- Type `npm start` to start the React Application

## Server

- In a new Terminal window, type: `cd server` to change directory into the server folder
- Type `npm install` to install npm dependencies
- Type `npm start` to start the Express Server

## MongoDB Database

- Start MongoDB in Docker by opening a terminal and `copy & paste` in the following:

```shell
docker run --name 02-project-reservationizr-application-part-2-mongo_db \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -v 02-exercise-auth0-express-react-mongo_db_data_container:/data/db \
  -d \
  mongo
```

- Connect to MongoDB using [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass). Create a database named `mongo`, a collection named `restaurants`, and load data from the [data](./data) folder into the database.

## Understand what already exists

The previous developer has left you some code. Run the React Application and Express API, and navigate through the folder structures to understand what exists and where you need to write your code.

Make sure you understand what API requests and responses you need to create. In particular, pay attention to the different status codes that are specified.

Once you have everything up and running and have familiarised yourself with the codebase, you can complete the following customer stories.

_Also note that the tests are mocking a user being signed in, the login user for your tests is `mock-user-id`. You can see this in [reservations.json](/data/reservations.json) file._

# API specification

To view the documentation for the API specification:

1. Open a Terminal in VS Code for this project
2. Type `cd server` to change directory into the server folder
3. Type `npm run docs` to start a web server with API documentation
4. Open the link displayed in your browser (it's automatically copied to your clipboard)

## Load the API Specification in Insomnia

You can automatically load all the available endpoints in Insomnia.

Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/dfaf8b47c6924f5ba04ce84dd1bdea1b), or follow the instructions below:

1. Go to the Insomnia Dashboard
2. Click the purple `Create` button
3. Select `File`.
4. Navigate into this exercise folder, and choose `server/e2e/api-spec.yml`.
5. Import as a `Request Collection`.
6. You can then open the Reservationizr API 1.0 Collection. Insomnia will load the endpoints for you.

## User Story #2 - View a single restaurant

- **As a** restaurant connoisseur
- **I want** to view restaurant details for a single restaurant
- **So that** I can determine if I want to reserve a table

**Acceptance criteria**

- Given the customer is viewing the list of restaurants in the React application, when the `Reserve now` button is clicked for a restaurant, then the customer is redirected to the `/restaurants/:id` route
- Given the customer is visiting the `/restaurants/:id` route in the React application, then the restaurant is displayed to the customer.
  - **Example url:** http://localhost:3000/restaurants/616005cae3c8e880c13dc0b9
- The page matches the design and is responsive.
- The route meets the API specification, and the automated API Specification test passes for this route.
- The code for the API is well tested with automated tests. Tests include happy and negative test cases.

## User Story #3 - Book a reservation

- **As a** restaurant connoisseur
- **I want** to book a reservation at a restaurant
- **So that** I can enjoy a meal at the restaurant

**Acceptance criteria**

- Given the customer is unauthenticated in the React application, when visiting the `/restaurants/:id` route, then the customer is redirected to the Auth0 Login page
  - **Note** You will need to make the `/restaurants/:id` route in `client/src/App.js` a protected route
- Given the customer is authenticated in the React application, when visiting the `/restaurants/:id` route, then a form is displayed to make a new reservation for the restaurant.
- Given the reservation form has been completed, when the form is submitted, then a new reservation is created by calling the API, and the customer is redirected to the `/reservations` route
  - **Note:** when authenticated, the user's id is stored on `req.auth.payload.sub` in the Express route handler.
- The route meets the API specification, and the automated API Specification test passes for this route.
  - **Note** To make the API specification tests for this route pass in GitHub, see the note below on adding Auth0 credentials to the GitHub repository.
- Validation requirements for the API are:
  - should not be able to create a reservation for 0 or fewer guests.
  - should not be able create a reservation in the past.
- The code for the API is well tested with automated tests. Tests include happy and negative test cases.
- The 'Make a reservation' form matches the design and is responsive.
  - **Note** Use [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker) for the Date input
